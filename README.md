### Hello, I'm Adam!   
***A bit about me:***  
🌷 Pronouns: he/him  
🪻 I’m interested in logic, details, 💐flowers💐, effective collaboration, accessible data, UX, pickleball, kindness, and paths forward.  
🪷 I’m currently learning MapBox, TypeScript, React, Tailwind, and FireBase.  
🌺 Fun facts: I competed in the College Curling National Championships and I was runner-up to David Lynch for a filmmaking award.  
🌻 I love to collaborate- if we both find it interesting, it's probably worth doing!
